## Centering the Edges: Sidewalks and Safety

Curb management will be crucial in the coming years for municipalities. Sidewalks and curbs serve as pedestrian passage, bike lanes, and for on-street parking. In a pandemic environment, they are additionally in constant use as ride-hailing service loading, retail and restaurant curbside pickup, parklets/outdoor dining, car-share space, EV charging, ADA spaces and ramps, food trucks, dockless bike and scooter locales, freight delivery and loading, and an increasing share of home deliveries. 
Yet many cities do not maintain digital inventories of their curbs.

## Introduction
Prior Data Development

In early 2018, the Department of Technologyâ€™s SFGIS division started to extend earlier right-of-way (RoW) delineation efforts that leveraged the Department of Public Works (PW) basemap.  
The initial scope was limited to beginning digitization of a planimetric geospatial line layer in order to develop specifications to place a request for proposal when my internship was finished. Instead, Brian and I developed and completed the digitization and attribution effort in house.
